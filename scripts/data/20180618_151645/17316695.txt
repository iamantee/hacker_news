This turned out to be a foolish move as it has proven difficult to find a new job (I had something lined up when I quit, but it fell through).<p>I did land a contract between then and now, but in order to survive I had about 1.5 months to find a new job and that hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>I was 3 days late on my rent this month and now have to appear in court to explain why i haven&#x27;t paid. I fully expect that to lead to an eviction.<p>I&#x27;ve never had an issue finding a job prior to this so I&#x27;m quite frustrated with myself.<p>I don&#x27;t own a good laptop (i use a desktop) and have about $400 to survive on. I&#x27;ve tried upwork but can&#x27;t drum anything up quick enough &#x2F; at all. I have multiple interviews lined up but I&#x27;m not hopeful at this point. I have things I can sell but I&#x27;m not sure how quick I can turn them around. My wife has a job but its only a couple days per week so not enough to survive on... she has another interview on monday but no clue how it will turn out of course. We own a car and are currently planning on a shelter (car is second plan).<p>The questions I have for HN are: what are my best options for survival? any pro tips on how to live on the streets and still land an engineering job?<p>Thanks in advance guys", "title": "Ask HN: How to survive as a homeless engineer?", "by": "homelessdev", "score": 176, "time": 1529024524, "type": "story", "id": 17316695}
