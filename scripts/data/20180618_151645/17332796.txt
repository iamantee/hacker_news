My day of work is mainly composed of integrating with AWS REST APIs and &quot;designing&quot; scalable distributed systems. \nI&#x27;m quoting designing, because it&#x27;s really just a matter of composing AWS Services to fit customers needs (provided clients are willing to throw money at cloud services - and most of the times they are).<p>I just feel that&#x27;s not something I would like to double down on. I have always enjoyed digging into lowish level libraries like MapReduce or LevelDB and figuring out how it works with layers of abstraction peeled off. I would love to contribute to such a project and I always envy and look up to Jeff Dean and his opportunity to build such a beautiful low-level software and libraries.<p>Anyway, are there companies which have interesting technical problems to solve and not consider outsourcing them to other vendors? Maybe I should get a job in a company which has a well established product (preferably something used by developers) and has some room for creativity?
