As a blind person I would like to make sure that my kids have turned off the lights. I have bin looking around the net and lots of the venders of smart lights seem a bit dodgy. What I would like to know is there any way of making a smart home safe from hackers. I know you cant make it completely safe but as safe as I can. All thoughts are welcome. I am happy to talk about being blind and techs role in my life too. Thanks.", "title": "A safe smart home for a blind dude?", "by": "tapper82", "score": 4, "time": 1529249682, "type": "story", "id": 17332784}
