But at much as we may have loved it, there comes a time when it becomes apparent that that particular string has played out, and it&#x27;s time to figure out what&#x27;s next. How do you know when that time has come -- and how do you figure out what your Next Thing is?<p>Case in point: I was once the &quot;OS&#x2F;2 goddess.&quot; I taught classes in operating systems internals, I wrote books about how to use it, I was OS&#x2F;2 network administrator for the electric company, I was a lead perpetrator in the user group community.<p>But when OS&#x2F;2 went away, so did my career. I didn&#x27;t want to admit it; after all, I was comfortable with that technology; I had great contacts and it was easy to do what I needed to; and I loved doing it.<p>However, at some point, there&#x27;s a &quot;come to Jesus&quot; moment. You tell yourself, &quot;It&#x27;s been a good run, but now it&#x27;s time to move on.&quot; In my case, it was when I realized I was getting gigs where I was paid to remove OS&#x2F;2 from a business, not install or maintain it.<p>...And then you have to think about what to do _instead_, and the lessons you should take away (&quot;I&#x27;m not going to hitch my career again to any company&#x27;s single product&quot;).<p>Sometimes the path is an obvious one (if you can write about one technical topic, you have enough cred to write about another). Sometimes, not so much.<p>What caused you to recognize &quot;I need to change my specialty&quot; and how did you decide what to do next?", "title": "Ask HN: How do you know when it's time to drop your specialty?", "by": "ohjeez", "score": 15, "time": 1529006206, "type": "story", "id": 17314827}
