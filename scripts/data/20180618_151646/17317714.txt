Sadly, many people do not even talk, and many with bipolar disorder commit suicide.<p>I know what it is to be in the dark cycle of bipolar. Last week, some personal issues triggered me to go from highly optimistic to extremely pessimistic.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to tell my employer that my mind in in another planet right now. I might loose might job since it has been 4 days I do not work (2 sick, 2 because of this).<p>The company is based in the US but fully remote. I am under a contract (and I am not US citizen), while values and culture is something that seemed to be important, recent weeks had been lots of changes and drama inside that I don&#x27;t think anyone would be able to put even themselves in my place.<p>I am burnt out. Personally and professionlly. I am under therapy and well surrunded. But just need a week break.<p>Last but not least, the company has a &quot;unlimited vacation policy&quot; and they say they force employees to go into vacation. In my last year, no one told me how or when. I think because some internal problems that we need ship fast and soon (or company might go bankrupt) they forgot this, which is not helping.<p>Should I just ask for vacation in the middle of the fire that we have inside? (I would look terrible to my co-workers&#x2F;team)\nShould I disclose I have bipolar? if so, how?<p>I personally don&#x27;t think anyone how is unfamiliar with bipolar disorder has any idea how hard life can turn. Even the most mundane task, turns into a hell.<p>Thank you", "title": "Ask HN: Bipolar is affecting my performance badly.
